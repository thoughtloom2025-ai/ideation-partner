# Tech Stack Selection & Deployment Guide

## Stack Selection Framework

When evaluating tech stacks, consider these factors in order of priority for the specific project:

1. **Project Requirements** - Functionality, performance, scale
2. **Team Expertise** - Current knowledge and learning curve
3. **Ecosystem Maturity** - Libraries, tools, community support
4. **Long-term Viability** - Maintenance, updates, hiring
5. **Cost Considerations** - Development, hosting, scaling costs

## Common Tech Stack Patterns

### Full-Stack Web Applications

**Modern JavaScript Stack**
- Frontend: React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt, Svelte/SvelteKit
- Backend: Node.js (Express, Fastify, Hono)
- Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
- Hosting: Vercel, Netlify, Railway, Render
- Consider: TypeScript for type safety, tRPC for end-to-end type safety

**Python Stack**
- Frontend: React/Next.js with Python API
- Backend: FastAPI, Django, Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL, SQLite
- Hosting: Render, Railway, AWS, Google Cloud
- Consider: Django for rapid development, FastAPI for APIs

**Rapid Prototyping**
- Stack: Next.js + Vercel + Supabase/Firebase
- Why: Fast deployment, managed backend, free tier
- Trade-offs: Vendor lock-in, scaling costs

### Mobile Applications

**Cross-Platform**
- React Native: Large ecosystem, web developer friendly
- Flutter: High performance, consistent UI
- Consider: Progressive Web App (PWA) for simpler needs

**Native**
- iOS: Swift + SwiftUI
- Android: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- Choose when: Performance critical, platform-specific features needed

## Database Selection

**Relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL)**
- Use when: Complex relationships, ACID compliance, structured data
- Strengths: Powerful queries, data integrity, mature ecosystem

**Document (MongoDB, Firestore)**
- Use when: Flexible schema, rapid iteration, nested data
- Strengths: Fast development, horizontal scaling

**Serverless (Supabase, Firebase, PlanetScale)**
- Use when: Fast deployment, managed infrastructure, variable load
- Strengths: Auto-scaling, free tier, integrated auth

**Considerations**
- Data relationships and query patterns
- Expected scale and growth
- Team expertise
- Backup and migration strategies

## Deployment Strategies

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

**Vercel** (Frontend-focused)
- Best for: Next.js, React, static sites
- Strengths: Zero config, edge network, preview deployments
- Limitations: Backend limitations, can be expensive at scale

**Netlify** (Frontend-focused)
- Best for: Static sites, JAMstack
- Strengths: Forms, functions, CI/CD
- Limitations: Function cold starts, less optimized for dynamic apps

**Railway/Render** (Full-stack)
- Best for: Full-stack apps, databases, microservices
- Strengths: Docker support, managed databases, simple pricing
- Limitations: Fewer regions, less mature than cloud providers

**Fly.io** (Edge deployment)
- Best for: Global distribution, low latency
- Strengths: Edge computing, Docker native
- Limitations: Newer platform, learning curve

### Cloud Providers

**AWS** (Comprehensive)
- Use when: Complex requirements, enterprise scale
- Strengths: Every service imaginable, mature
- Limitations: Complexity, cost management

**Google Cloud** (AI/ML focused)
- Use when: ML/AI features, BigQuery analytics
- Strengths: AI services, Firebase integration
- Limitations: Less intuitive than competitors

**DigitalOcean** (Developer-friendly)
- Use when: Simple infrastructure, cost-effective
- Strengths: Simple pricing, good docs
- Limitations: Fewer services than AWS/GCP

### Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)

**Supabase** (Open-source Firebase)
- Strengths: PostgreSQL, real-time, auth, storage
- Use when: Need relational DB with Firebase-like DX

**Firebase** (Google)
- Strengths: Real-time, auth, hosting, analytics
- Use when: Rapid development, mobile apps

**Convex** (Reactive backend)
- Strengths: Real-time, type-safe, reactive queries
- Use when: Real-time collaboration, reactive UIs

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Error tracking setup (Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] Analytics configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring ready
- [ ] Backup strategy defined
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates ready
- [ ] Domain DNS configured

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Authentication implemented correctly
- [ ] Authorization rules defined
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] CORS configured appropriately
- [ ] Secrets management (never commit secrets)
- [ ] API keys rotated and secured
- [ ] Database access restricted

### Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Database indexing optimized
- [ ] Caching strategy (Redis, CDN)
- [ ] Asset optimization (images, bundles)
- [ ] Load balancing if needed
- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] Horizontal scaling plan
- [ ] Cost monitoring and alerts

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Health checks configured
- [ ] Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- [ ] User feedback mechanism
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Incident response plan
- [ ] Performance baselines established

## Common Issues to Identify

### Architecture Issues
- Over-engineering for current needs
- Tight coupling between components
- Missing error handling
- No separation of concerns
- Inadequate data validation

### Scalability Issues
- N+1 query problems
- Missing database indexes
- Synchronous operations that should be async
- No caching strategy
- Single point of failure

### Security Issues
- Exposed API keys or secrets
- Missing authentication/authorization
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Insecure direct object references

### User Experience Issues
- Slow page loads (>3s initial)
- Missing loading states
- No error handling UI
- Poor mobile experience
- Accessibility barriers
